<p>I am writing this post with a flavour of story. Back in 2012, when very less number of people were using internet as compared to today’s time, I signed up for Facebook and also to the world of internet. At that point of time Facebook was itself growing by adapting newer technologies. Users were not able to see who is online in their friend list and who are not at that time. That feature was introduced later by Facebook. One thing Facebook did well even at that time is that it could be used at minimum internet speed and was accessible from all sort of devices. I was on my Nokia C101 phone. </p>

<p>Facebook used to be a great place to meet and talk to people all around India and even outside of India. So, I started adding friends of my common interests on Facebook. I found a lot of IT people and the community keep growing. Most of them were hackers, web developers, security researchers etc etc.. So, I kept learning a lot from them. From SQL Injection tricks to blogging, SEO techniques, I tried learning whatever I could. Joined a lot of Facebook groups too. </p>

<p>This kept going for 3 years and by the end of 2015, Facebook was booming in India and number of users increased to a significant number. Facebook started implementing latest technologies like machine learning to capture more and more users. Now Facebook became more addictive. Hours used to get passed just liking, commenting and scrolling down the news feeds. I realized that it was consuming a lot of my time, but I did not stop using it because I thought somehow Facebook is also helping me learning new stuffs too. </p>

<p>But in the year 2017, the scenario became totally different. I got aware that all social media platforms are becoming full of shitty stuffs. Facebook started overflowing with disgusting people, stupid memes, unlikeable videos, fake news, rumours, advertisements and what not. By the end of 2017, More than 300 millions of people in India started using Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, Goibibo, Twitter, LinkedIn etc, when rates of 4G internet packs started becoming very cheap. </p>

<p>So, I really felt like wasting a lot of time staying on Facebook or Instagram. By the starting of 2018, I completely backed off from these platforms and deleted all my social media accounts. Now I only use Youtube to view selected and specific channels. And I believe that’s really  enough. I also have a LinkedIn account which I rarely use. I do not find LinkedIn very helpful at this point of my life. </p>

<p>.....The End.....</p>
