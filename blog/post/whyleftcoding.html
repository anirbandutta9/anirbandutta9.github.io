<p>I have an interest for web development from the very beginning. Starting from the days when I was doing blogging using WordPress. But WordPress CMS has some limitations from the developerâ€™s point of view. So, I started learning core PHP programming along with MySql database focusing on the back-end development. Sources for learning were like Youtube, one Facebook group that I joined which really helped a lot and Google search of course. This helped me to gain a lot of knowledge on web programming and web applications. How they work, how they communicate with the databases, how the UI is implemented for end user experience, validations, API's, security implementations and all sort of things. I also learned about the database things like CRUD functionality, database dump etc. Simply what I mean to say is I got an overall experience of web development. But, then I realized I am not meant only for coding and web development. Also I hated the designing part. So, I had to move on to learn new skills like server administration, Linux, cloud etc. As I wanted to gain skills and pursue my career in this domain. I no longer write codes in a day to day basis but I can always use my learned skills of web development to create simple web applications like this website itself (which is a static one though) :)

Now coming to the web security part, I was learning about web security issues even before the web programming. Mostly I learned from my Facebook groups and communities of hackers, security professionals and some of the beginners like me. I learned some concepts like Sql injections, Cross site scripting, Google dorks exploitations etc. I used to message the professionals directly in their inbox to teach me about this concepts and I used to get positive response. But, frankly speaking from my experience one can only learn the basics this way. To know the advance concepts we need special hands-on training which I lacked. This might be one of the reason or excuse I made to leave web security as a career option. But I would suggest that infomation security is really a great career option for anyone who want to pursue it with interest.
