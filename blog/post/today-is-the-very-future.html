<p>If we start thinking deeply we certainly realize that our past happenings and the future are not real at this present moment. Our past is surely dead and our future is just our illusion. So, the question is why people are so concerned about the past and future? The only reality we have right now, right in the moment is our very present. But, rather than living this beautiful taday, why we always stay in our past and future using our imagination and thinking ability? </p>
<p> Let's first talk about the past. We keep thinking and imagining our past happenings which may be unpleasent and very bad experience or may be great even. But what we need to understand is that whatever happened is nothing but dead memory. Thinking about those and recreating the moments in our mind again and again is certainly not going to do any good for us. The impact of the past in our present depends on our reaction to it. So, we need proper understanding of these things.</p>  
<p> Like past, we also worry about our future. But study and research shows that 80% of the things we worry about the future happenings are not actually going to happen at all. When we start thinking about these, our brain also start reacting to it because our brain can not actually make a difference between imagination and reality. But the things we are thinking about are only imagination in reality. So, we have to understand that over thinking and worrying about tomorrow or the day after tomorrow is certainly going to waste our today. </p> 
<p>But, today is in our very hands. We can do whatever we want to do today. So, instead of thinking about past and future happenings, how about start doing what is in our hand right in front of us today and keep ourselves busy. Getting busy also helps to reduce 80% of our worries.</p>
<p>This is kind of a 'Today is the very future' formula using which a lot of people got benefited. Even when I applied this type of thinking to my personal and professional life, I got positive results.Give this a try, might help you too. </p> 
<p>.....The End.....</p>
